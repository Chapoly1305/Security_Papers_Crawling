# Security_Papers_Crawling
## Introduction
In this repo, we realize a crawler to crawl papers in S&P/CCS/USENIX Security/NDSS for reading papers in the security field according to the keywords given.

在本仓库，我们实现了一个根据给定关键词来爬取安全四大会论文的爬虫。

## Motivation
To our best knowledge, among existing crawlers in github, none has realized crawling papers according to the keywords, which makes screening papers still time-consuming.

我没找到现有可以实现根据关键词爬取论文的爬虫，就很烦，就自己实现一个。

## Method
We use new bing to help us code.

我用new bing辅助写的爬虫

## Limitation
- Sensitive to conference
